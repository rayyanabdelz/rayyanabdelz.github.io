    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: My Snake Game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a snake game in which 
	you can play by using the arrow keys once the game starts. Upon starting the sketch
	it starts with the snake starting from the centre of the sketch, as well as randomised
	ellipses scattered all around the 600 by 600 window of which need to be collected
	allowing the score to increase. The game will conclude by 2 scenarios, one by if a 
	player manoeuvres into its player's body and the second is when the player crashes into
	a wall.
